# Greg Go App

Greg Go is an asymmetric, app-based horror game. Users are assigned one of two roles: **Greg** or **Non-Greg**.

## How It Works

- When the app is launched, users are prompted to enter their name and upload a photo.
- If the user's name is **Greg**, they are shown a blank screen with an options menu in the top right, allowing them to change their name.
- If the user's name is **not Greg**, they are directed to a list of all users named Greg where they are able to select and hunt for a Greg.
- when a Non-Greg is within 3ft of a Greg they are able to take a photo of the Greg that is then stored in the Non-greg's "Greg gallery".
